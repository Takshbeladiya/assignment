Hypothesis Testing
Formulate the null and alternative hypothesis for the following statements.

a. We want to test whether the mean GPA of students in American colleges is different from 2.0
(out of 4.0).

a) Ho = 2.0
   Ha != 2.0
   It will be two - tail test


b. We want to test whether the mean height of eighth graders is 66 inches.

b)  Ho = 66 inch
    Ha != 66 inch
    It will be two - tail test


C We want to test if college students take less than five years to graduate from college, on the
average.

c) Ho >= 5 years
   Ha < 5 years
   Upper - level test

D We want to test if it takes fewer than 45 minutes to teach a lesson plan.

D)  Ho <= 45 min
    Ha > 45 min
    Lower - level test
